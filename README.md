# Merchandise-Carrying-Robot

##  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
A line follower robot has a simple algorithm, although it has evolved in recent years.
The robot/vehicle that we have designed is an automated vehicle that follows a visual line embedded on the surface. This visual line is a path on which the line follower robot runs. Generally, we can use a black line on a white surface, or you can adjust it as a white line on a black surface.
 This line follower is a concept that can be used in many situations, because of its simplicity of design and implementation. The advantages of the concept are its flexibility and the fact that it is autonomous—in other words, it can be used for long periods without monitoring.

##  COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
ARDUINO UNO
L298N MOTOR DRIVER
2 IR SENSORS
2 WHEEL CAR KIT WITH TWO TT MOTORS
CONNECTING/JUMPER WIRES
BREAD BOARD
SWITCH
2 HW BATTERIES

##  WORKING:
Here, we use the behaviour of light on the black and white surface. The white colour reflects all the light that falls on it, whereas the black colour absorbs the light.
In this line follower robot, we use IR transmitters and receivers (photodiodes). They are used to send and receive the lights. When IR rays fall on a white surface, it is reflected towards IR receiver, generating some voltage changes.
When IR rays fall on a black surface, it is absorbed by the black surface, and no rays are reflected; thus, the IR receiver doesn’t receive any rays.

APPLICATIONS:
In the medical field, a line follower can be used for automated stretchers that carry patients or as a tool for optimizing the patient reception system. Another utility in this domain is bringing food and drinks to patients in infectious disease wards, where medical staff aren’t able to safely interact with patients.

There are many applications for the line follower in our world today. It is used especially in industrial environment, performing tasks such as transportation, manipulation of different objects and as a replacement for conveyer belts. They are also well suited for domestic applications, such as floor cleaning or as service robots that follow you. In the future, the concept of the line follower is expected to be applied in several markets, including medical, transportation and construction.
